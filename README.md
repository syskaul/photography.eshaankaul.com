🛠️&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation
-
### 1. Deploy to Vercel

1. Deploy this repository to Vercel and connect the required services.
2. Add required storage ([Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/postgres) + [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob)) as part of template installation
   - _When creating new blob store, make sure to configure as "public"_
   - _Preferred postgres provider: Neon, from Vercel Marketplace_
3. Configure environment variable for production domain in project settings
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` (e.g., photos.domain.com—used in absolute urls and seen in navigation if no explicit nav title is set)

### 2. Setup Auth

1. [Generate auth secret](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) and add to environment variables:
   - `AUTH_SECRET`
2. Add admin user to environment variables:
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
3. Trigger redeploy
   - Visit project on Vercel, navigate to "Deployments" tab, click ••• button next to most recent deployment, and select "Redeploy"

### 3. Upload your first photo 🎉
1. Visit `/admin`
2. Sign in with credentials supplied in Step 2
2. Click "Upload Photos"
3. Add optional title
4. Click "Create"

🔄&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving updates
-
Deploy updates by pushing changes to the connected repository and redeploying the project.

💻&nbsp;&nbsp;Local development
-
1. Clone code
2. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
3. If necessary, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#installing-vercel-cli) and authenticate by running `vercel login`
4. Run `vercel link` to connect CLI to your project
5. Run `vercel dev` to start dev server with Vercel-managed environment variables

During local development, visit `/admin/configuration` to review required setup and optional integrations without signing in. This development-only access is not available in production.

See FAQ for [limitations of local development](#can-i-work-locally-without-access-to-an-image-storage-provider)

🎨&nbsp;&nbsp;Customization
-

### Content
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_TITLE` (seen in search results and browser tab)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_DESCRIPTION` (seen in search results)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAV_TITLE` (seen in top-right navigation, defaults to domain when not configured)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAV_CAPTION` (seen in top-right navigation, beneath title)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIDEBAR_TEXT` (seen in grid sidebar—accepts rich formatting tags: `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<br>`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_SHARE` (seen in share modals where a shorter url may be desirable)

### Analytics

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` to the project token in `.env.local` for local
development and in the deployment environment for production. The token is a
public project identifier used by the browser SDK; do not hardcode it in
source files. This setup uses the same Mixpanel project in every environment,
so development and production events will be mixed.

Mixpanel remains off until a visitor accepts the analytics prompt. The footer's
**Privacy settings** control lets visitors change their choice later. The
implementation records:

- `photo_detail_viewed`: `photo_id`, optional `photo_title`, and
  `view_context`
- `photo_share_action`: `photo_id`, optional `photo_title`, and `share_method`

Automatic page tracking and autocapture are disabled. Events use a
pseudonymous browser identifier; URL/referrer/UTM and browser/device/screen
properties are excluded, and IP-based geolocation is disabled. Private-photo
views, admin activity, and camera/exposure/location metadata are not tracked.

Before accepting consent for the first time, verify the project uses the
Simplified API and the `America/New_York` reporting timezone in Mixpanel
Project Settings. After deploying, accept analytics and confirm both events in
Mixpanel Live View.

### Performance
> ⚠️ Enabling may result in increased project usage. See FAQ for static optimization [troubleshooting hints](#why-do-production-deployments-fail-when-static-optimization-is-enabled).

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATICALLY_OPTIMIZE_PHOTOS = 1` enables static optimization for photo pages (`p/[photoId]`), i.e., renders pages at build time
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATICALLY_OPTIMIZE_PHOTO_OG_IMAGES = 1` enables static optimization for OG images, i.e., renders images at build time
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATICALLY_OPTIMIZE_PHOTO_CATEGORIES = 1` enables static optimization for photo categories (`shot-on/[make]/[model]`, etc.), i.e., renders pages at build time
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATICALLY_OPTIMIZE_PHOTO_CATEGORY_OG_IMAGES = 1` enables static optimization for photo category (`shot-on/[make]/[model]`, etc.) OG images, i.e., renders images at build time
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRESERVE_ORIGINAL_UPLOADS = 1` prevents photo uploads being compressed before storing
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_QUALITY = 1-100` controls the quality of large photos
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_BLUR = 1` prevents image blur data being stored and displayed (potentially useful for limiting Postgres usage)

### AI content generation

To enable AI-powered color analysis and text descriptions of photos, configure a provider. Vercel AI Gateway is the recommended path; direct OpenAI (or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint) is available as an alternate. If both variables are set, `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` takes precedence.

#### Vercel AI Gateway

1. Set `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL` to a [supported model](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers) using the `creator/model-name` format, e.g. `openai/gpt-5.2` — the model must support image input (vision)
2. If deployed on Vercel, no API key is required — [authentication happens automatically via OIDC](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway#authentication)
   - Outside Vercel (or for local development without `vercel env pull`), generate an API key from the [Vercel AI Gateway dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) and store it in `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
3. Add [rate limiting](#rate-limiting) (_recommended_)
4. Configure auto-generated fields (optional)
   - Set which text fields auto-generate when uploading a photo by storing a comma-separated list, e.g., `AI_TEXT_AUTO_GENERATED_FIELDS = title,semantic`
   - Accepted values:
     - `all`
     - `title` (default)
     - `caption`
     - `semantic` (default)
     - `none`

#### Alternate: Direct OpenAI (or OpenAI-compatible)

1. Setup OpenAI
   - Create an [OpenAI](https://openai.com) account and fund it if using the direct OpenAI provider.
   - Setup usage limits to avoid unexpected charges (_recommended_)
2. Generate API key and store in environment variable `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` (enable Responses API write access if customizing permissions)
   - Setting `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` overrides a configured `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL`
   - Set `OPENAI_MODEL` to choose a specific model (set to 'compatible' to use gpt-4o)
3. URL configuration (optional)
   - Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to use alternate OpenAI-compatible providers
4. Add [rate limiting](#rate-limiting) (_recommended_)
5. Configure auto-generated fields (optional, see above for instructions)

### Location

To add location meta to entities like photos and albums:

1. Setup Google Places/Geocoding API
   - [Create Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) if necessary
   - Enable "Places API (new)" (for finding places of interest)
   - Enable "Geocoding API" (for reverse lookup based on lat/long coordinates)
   - Select [Create credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and choose "API key"
   - Choose "Restrict key" and select "Places API (new)" + "Geocoding API"
2. Store API key in `GOOGLE_PLACES_GEOCODING_API_KEY`
3. Add [rate limiting](#rate-limiting) (_recommended_)

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEO_PRIVACY = 1` disables collection/display of location-based data (⚠️ re-compresses uploaded images in order to remove GPS information)
- `DISABLE_AUTO_GENERATE_LOCATIONS = 1` to disables auto-generation of location data

### Rate limiting

Create an Upstash Redis store from the Vercel dashboard and link it to your project to enable rate limiting.

### Categories
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CATEGORY_VISIBILITY`
  - Comma-separated value controlling which photo sets appear in grid sidebar and CMD-K menu, and in what order. For example, you could move cameras above films by updating to `cameras,lenses,recipes`.
  - Accepted values:
     - `recents` (default)
     - `years`
     - `cameras` (default)
     - `lenses` (default)
     - `recipes` (default)
     - `films` (default)
     - `focal-lengths`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_CATEGORIES_ON_MOBILE = 1` prevents categories displaying on mobile grid view
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_CATEGORY_IMAGE_HOVERS = 1` prevents images displaying when hovering over category links
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXHAUSTIVE_SIDEBAR_CATEGORIES = 1` always shows expanded sidebar content

### Sorting
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SORT`
  - Sets default sort on grid/full homepages
  - Accepted values:
    - `taken-at` (default)
    - `taken-at-oldest-first`
    - `uploaded-at`
    - `uploaded-at-oldest-first`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAV_SORT_CONTROL`
  - Controls sort UI on grid/full homepages
  - Accepted values:
    - `none`
    - `toggle` (default)
    - `menu`
- Color-based sorting (experimental)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SORT_BY_COLOR = 1` enables color-based sorting (forces nav sort control to "menu," flags photos missing color data in admin dashboard)—color identification benefits greatly from AI being enabled
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_COLOR_SORT_STARTING_HUE` controls which colors start first (accepts a hue of 0 to 360, default: 80)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_COLOR_SORT_CHROMA_CUTOFF` controls which colors are considered sufficiently vibrant (accepts a chroma of 0 to 0.37, default: 0.05):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIORITY_BASED_SORTING = 1` takes priority field into account when sorting photos (⚠️ enabling may have performance consequences)


### Display
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUT_TOOLTIPS = 1` hides keyboard shortcut hints in areas like the main nav, and previous/next photo links
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_CAMERA_DATA = 1` hides camera metadata in photo details and OG images
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALWAYS_SHOW_EXPOSURE_COMP = 1` displays exposure compensation even when it's 0ev
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_ZOOM_CONTROLS = 1` hides fullscreen photo zoom controls
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_TAKEN_AT_TIME = 1` hides taken at time from photo meta

### Grid
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRID_HOMEPAGE = 1` shows grid layout on homepage
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MASONRY_GRID = 1` shows photo grid homepage in masonry layout (keeping photo aspect ratios), also known as 'Pinterest style' or 'grid-lanes'
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRID_ASPECT_RATIO = 1.5` sets aspect ratio for grid tiles (defaults to `1`—setting to `0` removes the constraint)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_LARGE_THUMBNAILS = 1` ensures large thumbnails on photo grid views (if not configured, density is based on aspect ratio)

### Design
- Dark mode can be re-enabled by setting `DARK_MODE_ENABLED = true` in `src/app/config.ts`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_UPPERCASE_TITLES = 1` prevents photo titles and captions displaying in uppercase
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATTE_PHOTOS = 1` constrains the size of each photo, and displays a surrounding border, potentially useful for photos with tall aspect ratios (colors can be customized via `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATTE_COLOR` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATTE_COLOR_DARK`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINT_FOLDERS = 1` shows tinted folders on /library page
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIGH_DENSITY_PREVIEWS = 1` shows up to 6 photos in category image hovers and OG images (max defaults to 5)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_OG_TEXT_ALIGNMENT = BOTTOM` keeps OG image text bottom aligned (default is top)

### Settings

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCIAL_NETWORKS`
  - Comma-separated list of share modal options
  - Accepted values:
    - `x` (default)
    - `threads`
    - `facebook`
    - `linkedin`
    - `qrcode`
    - `all`
    - `none`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_FEEDS = 1` enables feeds at `/feed.json` and `/rss.xml`

### Debugging
- `DISABLE_DEBUG_OUTPUTS = 1`
  - removes build identifier in `<head />`
  - disables `/admin/configuration/export.json`

## Alternate storage providers

Only one storage adapter—Vercel Blob, Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, or MinIO—can be used at a time. Ideally, configure this before photos are uploaded. If you have multiple adapters, you can set one as preferred by storing `aws-s3`, `cloudflare-r2`, `minio`, or `vercel-blob` in `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_PREFERENCE`. See [FAQ](#will-there-be-support-for-image-storage-providers-beyond-vercel-aws-and-cloudflare) regarding unsupported providers.

### Cloudflare R2

1. Setup bucket
   - [Create R2 bucket](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) with default settings
   - Setup CORS under bucket settings:
   ```json
   [{
       "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
       "AllowedMethods": [
         "GET",
         "PUT"
       ],
       "AllowedOrigins": [
          "http://localhost:3000",
          "http://localhost:3001",
          "https://{VERCEL_PROJECT_NAME}*.vercel.app",
          "{PRODUCTION_DOMAIN}"
       ]
   }]
   ```
   - Enable public hosting by doing one of the following:
       - Select "Connect Custom Domain" and choose a Cloudflare domain
       - OR
       - Select "Allow Access" from R2.dev subdomain
   - Store public configuration:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET`: bucket name
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID`: account id (found on R2 overview page)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`: either "your-custom-domain.com" or "pub-jf90908...s0d9f8s0s9df.r2.dev"
2. Setup private credentials
   - Create API token by selecting "Manage R2 API Tokens," and clicking "Create API Token"
   - Select "Object Read & Write," choose "Apply to specific buckets only," and select the bucket created in Step 1
   - Store credentials (⚠️ _Ensure access keys are not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`_):
     - `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY`
     - `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### AWS S3

1. Setup bucket
   - [Create an S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3) with Object Ownership set to **Bucket owner enforced** (ACLs disabled)
   - Configure public photo delivery:
     - Keep `BlockPublicAcls` and `IgnorePublicAcls` enabled
     - Disable `BlockPublicPolicy` and `RestrictPublicBuckets` only if required to apply the public-read bucket policy below. Account-level or Organizations policies can still block public access.
     - Apply this bucket policy after replacing `{BUCKET_NAME}`. It grants anonymous reads only and rejects insecure transport:
       ```json
       {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": "*",
             "Action": "s3:GetObject",
             "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}/*"
           },
           {
             "Sid": "DenyInsecureTransport",
             "Effect": "Deny",
             "Principal": "*",
             "Action": "s3:*",
             "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}",
               "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}/*"
             ],
             "Condition": {
               "Bool": {
                 "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
               }
             }
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
       Do not grant public list, write, or delete access.
     - Enable default server-side encryption (SSE-S3)
   - Configure CORS for the exact site origins that need browser uploads:
     ```json
     {
       "CORSRules": [{
         "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT"],
         "AllowedOrigins": [
           "https://{PRODUCTION_DOMAIN}",
           "http://localhost:3000",
           "http://localhost:3001"
         ],
         "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
         "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
       }]
     }
     ```
     Replace `{PRODUCTION_DOMAIN}` with the production hostname and add any specific preview hostname that needs uploads. Do not use a broad `*` origin for authenticated uploads.
   - Store public configuration
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_BUCKET`: bucket name
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_REGION`: bucket region, e.g., "us-east-2"
2. Give the app server least-privilege access to the bucket. Prefer an IAM role or short-lived federated credentials; use an AWS profile/SSO for local development. The AWS SDK default credential provider chain is used when the optional static key variables below are unset.
   - Scope the IAM policy to this bucket:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}"
         },
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
     Do not add `s3:PutObjectAcl`: this setup uses **Bucket owner enforced** with ACLs disabled, and the app uploads and copies objects without setting ACLs. The app's S3 operations are covered by the bucket-level list permission and the object-level read, write, and delete permissions above.
   - For direct credentials from Vercel, create a dedicated IAM user with no console access, attach only the bucket-scoped policy above, and create an access key for an application running outside AWS.
   - Add these values to the Vercel project’s **Production** environment. Keep the access key variables server-only (never prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) and rotate them regularly:
     - `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY`
     - `AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_BUCKET`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_REGION`
   - For local development, use an AWS CLI profile/SSO where possible; otherwise set the same two key variables in the ignored `.env.local` file. Never commit credentials.
   - Public-read bucket policies make every uploaded object retrievable by anyone who knows its URL. Do not store sensitive or confidential content in this bucket.
   - For observability, enable S3 server access logging to a separate encrypted bucket, CloudTrail data events for this bucket, and CloudWatch request metrics. These may incur log storage, CloudTrail data-event, and CloudWatch custom-metric charges; see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

### MinIO

MinIO is a self-hosted S3-compatible object storage server.

#### 1. Server/bucket setup

First, install and deploy the MinIO server, then create a bucket with public read access.

- **Install MinIO:** [Follow official documentation](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/install-deploy-manage/deploy-minio-single-node-single-drive.html) to install and deploy MinIO.
- **Create bucket:**
  ```bash
  mc mb myminio/{BUCKET_NAME}
  ```
- **Set public read policy:** Create file named `bucket-policy.json` with the following content to allow read-only access:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": [
            "*"
          ]
        },
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}/*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  Next, apply this policy to your bucket:
  ```bash
  mc policy set myminio/photos bucket-policy.json
  ```
  
- **Store public configuration:** Set the following public environment variables for your application:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MINIO_BUCKET`: Bucket name
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MINIO_DOMAIN`: MinIO server endpoint, e.g., "minio.yourdomain.com"
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MINIO_PORT`: (optional)
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MINIO_DISABLE_SSL`: Set to `1` to disable SSL (defaults to HTTPS)

#### 2. Create user with restricted permissions

Create a dedicated user and a policy that grants permission to manage objects within your `BUCKET_NAME`.

- **Define user policy:** Create file named `user-policy.json`. This policy will allow the user to list the bucket contents and to get, put, and delete objects within it.
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:DeleteObject",
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:ListBucket",
          "s3:PutObject"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}/*",
          "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Create policy:** Add named policy to MinIO.
  ```bash
  mc admin policy add myminio photos-manager-policy user-policy.json
  ```
- **Create user:** Create new user with access key and secret key.
  ```bash
  mc admin user add myminio {MINIO_ACCESS_KEY} {MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
  ```
- **Attach policy to user:** Assign `photos-manager-policy` to the user.
  ```bash
  mc admin policy set myminio photos-manager-policy user=MINIO_ACCESS_KEY
  ```
- **Store private credentials:** Set the following private environment variables for your application. ⚠️ **Ensure these access keys are not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`**.
  - `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`: Your MINIO_ACCESS_KEY
  - `MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Alternate database providers (experimental)

Vercel Postgres can be switched to another Postgres-compatible, pooling provider by updating `POSTGRES_URL`. Some providers only work when SSL is disabled, which can configured by setting `DISABLE_POSTGRES_SSL = 1`.

### Supabase
1. Ensure connection string is set to "Transaction Mode" via port `6543`
2. Disable SSL by setting `DISABLE_POSTGRES_SSL = 1`

### Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with Vercel OIDC

The app can use short-lived IAM database authentication tokens instead of a
stored PostgreSQL password. Enable `POSTGRES_IAM_AUTH_ENABLED = 1` and configure
these server-side Vercel environment variables:

- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: IAM role trusted by your Vercel project through OIDC
- `AWS_REGION`: the Aurora cluster's region (for example, `us-east-2`)
- `PGHOST`: Aurora cluster endpoint
- `PGPORT`: database port (usually `5432`)
- `PGUSER`: PostgreSQL user granted the `rds_iam` role
- `PGDATABASE`: database name (defaults to `postgres`)

Enable IAM database authentication on the cluster and grant the Vercel IAM role
`rds-db:connect` for only the intended database user. Restrict the role trust
policy to the specific Vercel team, project, and environment. The [Vercel AWS
integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/aws) can configure OIDC and database
connectivity; do not make an Aurora cluster publicly accessible to connect it
from Vercel. For local development without Vercel OIDC, omit `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and
use an AWS CLI profile or other AWS SDK default credentials. The local AWS
principal still needs `rds-db:connect`, and the machine must have network access
to the cluster. Do not store a generated IAM auth token in `POSTGRES_URL`;
tokens expire after 15 minutes and are generated automatically for new pool
connections.

📖&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ
-
#### How do I receive template updates?
> For repository updates, push the changes to the connected Git repository and redeploy from the Vercel project.

#### How do I edit multiple photos?
> In the admin menu, select "Batch edit ..." From there, you can perform bulk album, visibility, and delete actions.

#### Why don't my photo changes show up immediately?
> This template statically optimizes core views such as `/` and `/grid` to minimize visitor load times. Consequently, when photos are added, edited, or removed, it might take several minutes for those changes to propagate. If it seems like a change is not taking effect, try navigating to `/admin/configuration` and clicking "Clear Cache."

#### Why do production deployments fail when static optimization is enabled?
> Large photos (over 30MB), or a CDN such as Cloudflare in front of Vercel, may destabilize static optimization.

#### Why don't my older photos look right?
> As the site evolves, camera metadata, blur data, and AI/privacy features may be updated. To refresh older photos, click the 'sync' button next to a photo or visit photo updates (`/admin/photos/updates`).

#### Why don't my OG images load when I share a link?
> Many services such as iMessage, Slack, and X, require near-instant responses when unfurling link-based content. In order to guarantee sufficient responsiveness, consider rendering pages and image assets ahead of time by enabling static optimization by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATICALLY_OPTIMIZE_PHOTOS = 1` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATICALLY_OPTIMIZE_PHOTO_OG_IMAGES = 1`. Keep in mind that this will increase platform usage.

#### Why do vertical images take up so much space?
> By default, all photos are shown full-width, regardless of orientation. Enable matting to showcase horizontal and vertical photos at similar scales by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATTE_PHOTOS = 1`.

#### Why are my grid thumbnails so small?
> Thumbnail grid density (seen on `/grid`, category overviews, and other photo sets) is dependent on aspect ratio configuration (ratios of 1 or less have more photos per row). This can be overridden by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_LARGE_THUMBNAILS = 1`.

#### My images/content have fallen out of sync with my database and/or my production site no longer matches local development. What do I do?
> Navigate to `/admin/configuration` and click "Clear Cache."

#### I'm seeing server-side runtime errors when loading a page after updating my fork. What do I do?
> Navigate to `/admin/configuration` and click "Clear Cache." If this doesn't help, contact the site maintainer.

#### Why can’t I upload HEIC files?
> This site relies on `sharp` to manipulate images and `next/image` to serve them, neither of which currently support HEIC (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30043 + https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/3981). HEIC files uploaded from native share controls on Apple platforms are automatically converted to JPG.

#### Why are my thumbnails square?
> Absent configuration, the default grid aspect ratio is `1`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRID_ASPECT_RATIO` can be set to any number (for instance, `1.5` for 3:2 images) or ignored by setting to `0`.

#### Why aren't Fujifilm simulations importing with camera metadata?
> Fujifilm simulation data is stored in vendor-specific MakerNote data embedded in image metadata. Some editing or sharing tools may strip this data. If a simulation is missing, try importing the original camera file or select the simulation manually when editing the photo.

#### My Fujifilm recipes are missing/displaying incorrect data. What should I do?
> If you don't see a recipe, first try syncing your photo from the ••• menu, or from `/admin/photos`. If the data looks incorrect, open an issue with the file in question attached in order for it to be investigated. Fujifilm file specifications have evolved over time and recipe parsing may need to be adjusted based on camera model/vintage.

#### How do I hide Fujifilm content such as a recipes and film simulations?
> This can be accomplished by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_CATEGORY_VISIBILITY` (which has a default value of `recents,albums,cameras,lenses,recipes,films`) to `cameras,lenses`.

#### Why do my images appear flipped/rotated incorrectly?
> Image orientations 1, 3, 6, and 8 are supported. Orientations 2, 4, 5, and 7—which use mirroring—are not supported.

#### Why does my image placeholder blur look different from photo to photo?
> Earlier versions of this template generated blur data on the client, which varied visually from browser to browser. Data is now generated consistently on the server. If you wish to update blur data for a particular photo, edit the photo in question, make no changes, and choose "Update."

#### Why are large, multi-photo uploads not finishing?
> The default timeout for processing multiple uploads is 60 seconds (the limit for Hobby accounts). This can be extended to 5 minutes on Pro accounts by setting `maxDuration = 300` in `src/app/admin/uploads/page.tsx`.

#### I've added my OpenAI key but can't seem to make it work. Why am I seeing connection errors?
> You may need to pre-purchase credits before accessing the OpenAI API. If you've customized key permissions, make sure write access to the Responses API is enabled.

#### How do I generate AI text for preexisting photos?
> Once AI text generation is configured, photos missing text will show up in photo updates (`/admin/photos/updates`).

#### Will there be support for image storage providers beyond Vercel, AWS, Cloudflare, and MinIO?
> At this time, there are no plans to introduce support for new storage providers. The template now supports Vercel Blob, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, and MinIO (self-hosted S3-compatible storage). While configuring other AWS-compatible providers should not be too difficult, there's nuance to consider surrounding details like IAM, CORS, and domain configuration, which can differ slightly from platform to platform. If you'd like to contribute an implementation for a new storage provider, please open a PR.

#### Can I work locally without access to an image storage provider?
> At this time, an external storage provider is necessary in order to develop locally. If you have a strategy to propose which allows files to be locally uploaded and served to `next/image` in away that mirrors an external storage provider for debugging purposes, please open a PR.

#### Can this template be self-hosted?
> Possibly. Image hosting and Docker configuration depend on the selected storage provider.

#### Why am I seeing many merge conflicts when syncing my fork?
> This site uses the Next.js App Router. Keep application routes in `/app` and shared application code in `/src`.
